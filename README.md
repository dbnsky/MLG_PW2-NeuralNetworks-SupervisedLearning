# 1. Explore the “hold_out_validation” notebook 

## Q1. Determine where do we define all the above mentioned parameters.
Observe that we run the evaluation procedure on four different problems. Each problem is
a two-class two-dimensional problem, where the two sets are more and more overlapped
(e.g., the synthetic datasets are randomly generated using variances of 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and
0.7).
## Q2. What are the cyan and red curves in those plots ? Why are they different ?
## Q3. What happens with the training and test errors (MSE) when we have the two sets more overlapped ?
## Q4. Why sometimes the red curves indicate a higher error than the cyan ones ?
## Q5. What is showing the boxplot summarizing the validation errors of the preceding experiments ? 


# 2. Explore the “cross_validation” notebook 
## Q1. Determine where do we define all the above mentioned parameters.
## Q2. What is the difference between hold-out and cross-validation ? What is the new parameter that has to be defined for cross-validation ?
## Q3. Observe the boxplots summarizing the validation errors obtained using the crossvalidation method and compare them with those obtained by hold-out validation.
